- [X] Return the relevant status codes for both successful and unsuccessful requests to the API.
- [X] Handle failed requests gracefully (e.g. you should have a custom 404 page rather than the default error page). *(ONGOING - INCLUDE OTHER CUSTOMER PAGES like 405, 500 etc)*

## Additional Notes
No additional libraries or frameworks, other than what we use in class, are allowed unless approved by the Lead Mentor.

Note that while this is a crowdfunding website, actual money transactions are out of scope for this project.

Please include the following in your readme doc:
- [X] A link to the deployed project üëâ [Please click here](https://earisistable-6e77c5ae1c72.herokuapp.com/)
- [X] A screenshot of Insomnia, demonstrating a successful GET method for any endpoint (see below).
![GET Request - Deployed Heroku](./README_img/Screenshot_GetRequest.gif)
- [X] A screenshot of Insomnia, demonstrating a successful POST method for any endpoint (see below).
![POST Request - Deployed Heroku](./README_img/Screenshot_PostRequest.gif)
- [X] A screenshot of Insomnia, demonstrating a token being returned (see below).
![TOKEN Request - Deployed Heroku](./README_img/Screenshot_TokenRequest.gif)
- [X] Step by step instructions for how to register a new user and create a new project (i.e. endpoints and body data).
####  CREATE NEW USER - How To
1. In Insomnia, create a new `POST` request.
2. In the URL searchbar (next to `POST`), add your Heroku deployed link, followed by `/users/`. For example:
```
https://your-deployed-link/users/
```
3. Select `Body`, and then select `JSON`. This will be used to add the body data for creating a new user.
4. Inside the `JSON` file, copy and paste this body data below. Replace any of the `insert-here` texts with your unique username and password, ensuring they are inside the double-quotation marks:
```
{
    "username": "insert-username-here",
    "password": "insert-password-here"
}
```
5. Select `Send`, and it will now return your recently created user details.
